**Assignment title: ** Visual Prompt Studio Phase 1.1

**Prompt** 
Create a portrait of a woman reading under a tree, in the style of an impressionist oil painting from the late 19th century, with warm pastel tones, soft lighting, and a balanced composition emphasizing harmony and movement. Highlight the themes of solitude and intellectual freedom by isolating the woman from a softly blurred background to imply depth. Introduce a distant village in the background for context. Create a strong focal point on the woman and the book by using value contrast between her figure and the three against the softer background.

**Vocabulary Breakdown**
Oil Paint: A type of painting that uses oil, very popular since the 15th century
Impressionist style: An art movement that originated in Paris, focusing on capturing light and beauty, often painted outdoors to depict modern scenes like leisure. It uses short brushstrokes.
Imply Depth: A series of techniques artists use to convey a sense of space and perspective in two-dimensional works. 
Focal point: A principle of design used to guide our attention to a certain area in the composition.

**Reflection**
The image generated is depicting an Impressionist style because the short brushstrokes are very evident throughout the composition. I decided to include a woman reading a book outdoors because Impressionist paintings usually depict beauty and leisure in outdoor settings. The focal point of the woman reading the book is created not only by blurring the background but also by her position and size. She is bigger than the buildings of the village behind her, which implies that she is closer to us and therefore appears larger. Also, the darker value of the tree contrasts with the lighter values in the rest of the composition, guiding our eyes to this section and creating emphasis.
In the second image, I experimented with the values in the composition to play with depth. I asked Copilot to include darker values for the woman and the tree, and much lighter values for the village. I also played with placement by asking Copilot to move the village much higher in the composition to give the impression that it was up on top of a hill. These two changes made the image highlight the theme of isolation even more. I noticed that by adding darker values, the mood changed, it appeared sadder, making the theme of isolation feel less about leisure and more about other reasons that don’t really communicate beauty. The short brushstrokes were less evident in the final result.
